# Data Cleaning Project

## Usage: 
To replicate the Data Cleaning workflow you can open the jupyter notebook, and run all cells. The notebook uses standard anaconda packages to clean the data, so given that you have an Python Anaconda distribution, you should be able to run it. The notebook will create billboard_ratings.csv which you can load into excel or jupyter lab and this should contain the clean billboard chart rating dataset.

For more information in the data cleaning workflow you can go trough the notebook preview which explains all steps. To get a information on this assesment you can read the *InitialAssesment.pdf* provided in the repository.

The python file **wrangling.py** it is also provided to create *billboard_ratings.csv* directly.

## Requirements: 
- Python 3.7 (Anaconda Distribution)
