# Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) Project

## Usage: 
To replicate the Data Cleaning and EDA you can open the jupyter notebook, and run all cells. The notebook uses standard anaconda packages to clean the data, so given that you have an Python Anaconda distribution, you should be able to run it. The notebook will create 'cleaned_data.csv' which you can load into excel or jupyter lab and this should contain the order data in integer with categorical titles of weeks and days.

For more information in the workflow you can go trough the notebook preview which explains all steps. To get a information on this assesment you can read the *InitialAssessment.pdf* provided in the repository.


## Requirements: 
- Python 3.7 (Anaconda Distribution)
