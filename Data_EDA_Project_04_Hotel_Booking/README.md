# Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) Project

## Usage: 
To replicate the Data Cleaning and EDA, you can open the jupyter notebook, and run all cells. The notebook uses standard anaconda packages to clean the data and plotly library to visualize interactive graphs, so given that you have an Python Anaconda distribution with plotly installed, you should be able to run it and see all data visualization.

Regarding Plotly installation in Python, please follow the instructions in the link below:
